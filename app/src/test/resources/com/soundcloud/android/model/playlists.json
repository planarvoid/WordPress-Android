The five tracks of 'New Brutalism' are a product of their Northern environment, making pointed reference to the kind of deep-rooted rave heritage documented in Mark Leckey's 'Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore' soundtrack through a prism of angular, vulnerable club music. Conceptually, It adopts a similar perspective on British nightlife to Burial or Lee Gamble, surveying the 'floor as if during an out-of-body experience or through closed eyes from a corner of the club at 5am. Opening track, 'UK Will Not Survive' captures that sensation beautifully with its tape-saturated layers of wistful vocal, woody 2-step and daubs of Reese bass, whilst 'Three Day Jag' isolates that curious blend of hedonism and introspection innate to early UK 'ardcore, albeit without the narco-sweats. Closing number 'Run Out' doffs a cap to grey building sites and strobe-lit clubs alike, channelling diffuse field recordings and half-heard breakbeats with a bleary-eyed, tired and emotional quality.","genre":"Electronic","release":null,"purchase_title":null,"label_name":null,"title":"Rainer Veil -  New Brutalism","release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/21772512","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/modernlove/sets/rainer-veil-new-brutalism","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000069447067-y2332j-large.jpg?30a2558","user":{"id":285209,"kind":"user","permalink":"modernlove","username":"modernlove","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/285209","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/modernlove","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000000678532-co7r0d-large.jpg?30a2558"},"tracks_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/21772512/tracks","created_with":{"id":46941,"kind":"app","name":"SoundCloud.com","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/apps/46941","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/apps/v2-on-https-soundcloud-com","external_url":"","creator":"spadgos"}},{"kind":"playlist","id":21013088,"created_at":"2014/01/23 18:37:50 +0000","user_id":5234467,"duration":445633,"sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"The Bunker New York\" Psychedelic \"deep techno\" \"underwater house\" \"dub techno\" \"expansive music\"","permalink":"clay-wilson-the-bunker-new-1","track_count":3,"streamable":true,"downloadable":false,"embeddable_by":"all","purchase_url":"http://thebunkerny.bandcamp.com/album/the-bunker-new-york-002","label_id":null,"type":"ep single","playlist_type":"ep single","ean":"","description":"Clay Wilson\u2019s life story is, for the most part, a mystery.  Little is known about the 24-year-old producer, who began turning heads with mesmerizing tracks from his home base in Brooklyn last year. The deeply psychedelic groove of Clay\u2019s debut release for Brooklyn's Styles Upon Styles\u2019 Bangers and Ash series immediately caught our attention.  \r\n \r\nBefore Wilson started making techno, he studied improvisation at music school in upstate New York. Wilson played bass, studying with noted jazz musicians who had worked with Ornette Coleman, Alice Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, and many artists who recorded for the ECM label. He counts Coleman, Coltrane, and Art Ensemble of Chicago among his major inspirations. You can sense the subtle traces of Wilson\u2019s avant-garde jazz training in his techno. You can hear the shifting layers of intriguing textures in the music, his deep understanding of the low end, of arranging and composition, of form. \u201cUnderstanding the foundation of form has allowed me to not worry so much about putting loops into a full \u2018song\u2019, which seems to be a common thing with electronic music,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the textures kind of come from trying to get away from standard musical ideas.\u201d\r\n \r\nWhile nerding out over our mutual love of fine craft beers and deep techno, we asked Wilson to create some music for our (then hypothetical) new label, and he obliged, in spades. Wilson was already a big fan of The Bunker, and a regular at our parties.  He had already started making music before experiencing The Bunker, but the sound of the party inspired him massively, and helped him to refine his own aesthetic.  He was deeply moved by Bunker sets by Voices From The Lake, Demdike Stare, Peter Van Hoesen, the Interdimensional Transmissions crew, Bee Mask, Atom\u2122, Tobias, and many more.\r\n\r\nWilson sent a lot of music our way over the next few months, and what you have here are our three favorites, culled from the pile with help from our resident DJ Eric Cloutier.\r\n \r\nMastered by: Neel at EnissLab\r\nCut at Dubplates and Mastering\r\nPressed at Brooklyn Phono\r\n ","genre":"Clay Wilson","release":"BK-002","purchase_title":"Buy","label_name":"The Bunker New York","title":"Clay Wilson - The Bunker New York 002 - preview clips","release_year":2014,"release_month":2,"release_day":17,"license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/21013088","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/thebunkerny/sets/clay-wilson-the-bunker-new-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000068828296-fazscf-large.jpg?30a2558","user":{"id":5234467,"kind":"user","permalink":"thebunkerny","username":"thebunkerny","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/5234467","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/thebunkerny","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000066945049-9ofm7m-large.jpg?30a2558"},"tracks_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/21013088/tracks","created_with":{"id":46941,"kind":"app","name":"SoundCloud.com","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/apps/46941","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/apps/v2-on-https-soundcloud-com","external_url":"","creator":"spadgos"}},{"kind":"playlist","id":14009461,"created_at":"2013/11/07 09:44:03 +0000","user_id":28789021,"duration":207952,"sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"Kennedy Smith\" \"808 Fake\" STABLO \"Radio Slave\" Vinyl Berlin \"The Double R\"","permalink":"rr003-cherry-pie-1","track_count":2,"streamable":true,"downloadable":false,"embeddable_by":"all","purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"type":"ep single","playlist_type":"ep single","ean":"","description":"Third release from the much anticipated imprint involving the founders of STABLO alongside Matt 'Radio Slave' Edwards.\r\n\r\nLabel: The Double R \u200e\u2013 RR003 \r\nFormat: Vinyl, 33 \u2153 RPM, 12\", White Label, Limited Edition, Numbered \r\nCountry: Germany \r\nReleased: December 2013 \r\nGenre: Electronic \r\nStyle: Dub, House, Techno","genre":"Electronic","release":"RR003","purchase_title":null,"label_name":"The Double R","title":"RR003 CHERRY PIE","release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/14009461","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/the-double-r/sets/rr003-cherry-pie-1","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000062108627-ah3mz3-large.jpg?30a2558","user":{"id":28789021,"kind":"user","permalink":"the-double-r","username":"The Double R","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/28789021","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/the-double-r","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000037459686-32fvd9-large.jpg?30a2558"},"tracks_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/14009461/tracks"},{"kind":"playlist","id":13369467,"created_at":"2013/10/29 22:29:12 +0000","user_id":108914,"duration":1038247,"sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"Just Another Beat\" Album","permalink":"somewhere-else-its-going-to-be","track_count":10,"streamable":true,"downloadable":false,"embeddable_by":"all","purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"type":"album","playlist_type":"album","ean":"","description":"Kim Brown\r\nSomewhere Else It's Going To Be Good \r\nJust Another Beat (JAB08)\r\n\r\n2x12\" (incl. download code) / Digital\r\nDistribution: Hardwax (Vinyl), Morr Music (Digital)\r\n\r\nRelease Date: \r\nNovember 18th 2013 (Vinyl)\r\nNovember 29th 2013 (Digital)\r\n\r\nTracklist Vinyl:\r\n\r\nA1.
