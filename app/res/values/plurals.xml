    The plurals on this file were extracted from the the strings.xml file
    since they contain 3 forms of plural, which should not happen for english.
    English should only have two plural forms ("one" and "other")

    This facilitates the translation of strings via Transifex,
    which does not support more than 2 quantity types for english

    Until this translation issue on Transifex is fixed, we will keep this file.
    When it is fixed, we should move these plurals back to the strings.xml file.
