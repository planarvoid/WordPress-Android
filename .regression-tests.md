# Ads

Note : We are not allowed to run the automated tests against the production ad server. We can, however, locally trigger the automated tests on the release branch if we use the debug buildType. To do this, checkout the release branch locally and run the ads tests, then verify the following:

- [ ] Ad is shown before monetizable track
- [ ] Leave behind is shown after ad
- [ ] Ad without leave behind is shown before monetizable track
- [ ] Interstitial is shown over a monetizable track played from a list
- [ ] Interstitial is shown over a monetizable track that is auto-advanced to
- [ ] Promoted track is shown in stream
- [ ] Promoted playlist is shown in stream
- [ ] Ad event tracking sent to EventLogger & Promoted


# Tracking
- [ ] Event tracking to EventGateway (check requests to http://eventgateway.soundcloud.com)
- [ ] Event tracking to AppBoy (check requests to https://serpens.iad.appboy.com:443)
- [ ] Playback start sends play count increment to public API (seeking doesn't) - (POST request to /tracks/<track_urn>/plays)
- [ ] Comscore tracking (check request to http://b.scorecardresearch.com)
- [ ] Adjust tracking (check request to https://app.adjust.io:443)
- [ ] Changing users will change the user ID we send with Analytics requests (look at "user" for EventGateway and the request headers for AppBoy)


# Age Gating
There are already integration tests for it (see ageGating). All you have to do is to check if the proper notification appears.
More info about the current config: https://github.com/soundcloud/public-api-strangler/blob/master/src/main/resources/user-follow-restrictions.json
NOTE: You can use the test user 'childuserblah' (pw: passwordyeah88) to perform these tests
- [ ] With an user which has an age inferior to 18 years old, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be shown a notification.
- [ ] With an user which does not have its age defined, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be prompted for your age
