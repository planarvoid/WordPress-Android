# Ads

Note : we are not allowed anymore to test automatically advertisements but we still have
 the acceptance tests. To test the following trigger them manually and watch - rather than
 doing yourself the same steps.

- [ ] Ad is shown before monetizable track
- [ ] Leave behind is shown after ad
- [ ] Ad without leave behind is shown before monetizable track
- [ ] Interstitial is shown over a monetizable track played from a list
- [ ] Interstitial is shown over a monetizable track that is auto-advanced to
- [ ] Promoted track is shown in stream
- [ ] Promoted playlist is shown in stream
- [ ] Ad event tracking sent to EventLogger & Promoted


# Tracking
- [ ] Event tracking to EventGateway (check requests to http://eventgateway.soundcloud.com)
- [ ] Event tracking to AppBoy (check requests to https://serpens.iad.appboy.com:443)
- [ ] Playback start sends play count increment to public API (seeking doesn't) - (POST request to /tracks/<track_urn>/plays)
- [ ] Comscore tracking (check request to http://b.scorecardresearch.com)
- [ ] Adjust tracking (check request to https://app.adjust.io:443)
- [ ] Changing users will change the user ID we send with Analytics requests (look at "user" for EventGateway and the request headers for AppBoy)


# Age Gating
There are already integration tests for it (see ageGating). All you have to do is to check if the proper notification appears.
More info about the current config: https://github.com/soundcloud/public-api-strangler/blob/master/src/main/resources/user-follow-restrictions.json
NOTE: You can use the test user 'childuserblah' (pw: passwordyeah88) to perform these tests
- [ ] With an user which has an age inferior to 18 years old, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be shown a notification.
- [ ] With an user which does not have its age defined, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be prompted for your age
