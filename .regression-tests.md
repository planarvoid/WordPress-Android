# Ads

We are not allowed to run the automated tests against the production ad server.
We can, however, locally trigger the automated tests on the release branch if we use the debug buildType.
To do this, checkout the release branch locally and run the tests in the `player.ads` package.

- [ ] Acceptance tests passed

Some things have to be tested manually (release branch devDebug), using a free-tier user that has items in the stream please check that:

- [ ] Promoted track is shown in stream
- [ ] Promoted playlist is shown in stream (pull to refresh the stream)
- [ ] Ad event tracking sent to EventLogger & Promoted (400 response is OK)
- [ ] Vertical video ads (deep-link [here](https://soundcloud.com/scandroidad1/sets/vertical-video-ad)) change & lock the player orientation to portrait
- [ ] Player orientation is no longer locked once ad has been skipped

**NOTE:** The availability of promoted stream items depends on several factors. Builds talking to api-mobile-alpha
will always get them. In beta and prod environments, frequency caps apply as well as geographic region.
The latter can be circumvented by being in the `cloud_people` feature group.


# Tracking and Settings
1. Set your phone up with [Charles proxy]( https://github.com/soundcloud/android-listeners/wiki/Debugging-Network-requests-with-Charles-from-your-Phone---Tablet)
2. It may be easier to test if you enable the "Flush EventLogger instantly" option in the developer menu
3. Verify that the following requests are made:
    - [ ] Event tracking to EventGateway (check requests to https://telemetry.soundcloud.com)
    - [ ] Event tracking to AppBoy (check requests to https://serpens.iad.appboy.com:443)
    - [ ] Adjust tracking (check request to https://app.adjust.com:443, after fresh install of the app)
    - [ ] Changing users will change the user ID we send with Analytics requests (look at "user" for EventGateway)
    - [ ] Requests to [b.scorecardresearch.com]
    - [ ] Requests to Crashlytics [e.crashlytics.com]
    - [ ] Turning off Analytics and Crashlogs in `Settings > Basic Settings` and restarting the app doesn't show the requests to ScoreCard and Crashlytics
    - [ ] Sanity check by turning the settings back on, restarting the app and the requests should appear again
4. Clearing Cache
    - [ ] `Settings > Basic Settings > Clear application cache` shows "Cache cleared success message"


# Age Gating
You can use the test users 'underage@sc.com' (pw: underage) and 'soundcloud.manual.ageless@tests.soundcloud' (pw: SoundCloudTest2016) to perform these tests
**Please don't change their ages so we can keep using them specifically for this test**

- [ ] With an user which has an age inferior to 18 years old (depending on the country this might change, for example, 14 in Germany), attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be shown a notification.
- [ ] With an user which does not have its age defined, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be prompted for your age (do not fill out the age data please!).


# Dev features
- [ ] Login with a non `cloud_people` user and verify the dev drawer is not there.
