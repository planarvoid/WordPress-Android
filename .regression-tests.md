# Ads

We are not allowed to run the automated tests against the production ad server.
We can, however, locally trigger the automated tests on the release branch if we use the debug buildType.
To do this, checkout the release branch locally and run the tests in the `player.ads` package.

- [ ] Acceptance tests passed

Some things have to tested manually, please check that:

- [ ] Promoted track is shown in stream
- [ ] Promoted playlist is shown in stream
- [ ] Ad event tracking sent to EventLogger & Promoted
- [ ] [Vertical video ads](https://soundcloud.com/scandroidad1/sets/vertical-video-ad) change & lock the player orientation to portrait
 - [ ] Player orientation is no longer locked once ad has been skipped

**NOTE:** The availability of promoted stream items depends on several factors. Builds talking to api-mobile-alpha
will always get them. In beta and prod environments, frequency caps apply as well as geographic region.
The latter can be circumvented by being in the `cloud_people` feature group.


# Tracking
- [ ] Event tracking to EventGateway (check requests to https://telemetry.soundcloud.com)
- [ ] Event tracking to AppBoy (check requests to https://serpens.iad.appboy.com:443)
- [ ] Comscore tracking (check request to http://b.scorecardresearch.com)
- [ ] Adjust tracking (check request to https://app.adjust.io:443, after fresh install of the app)
- [ ] Changing users will change the user ID we send with Analytics requests (look at "user" for EventGateway)


# Age Gating
You can use the test users 'underage@sc.com' (pw: underage) and 'soundcloud.manual.ageless@tests.soundcloud' (pw: SoundCloudTest2016) to perform these tests
**Please don't change their ages so we can keep using them specifically for this test**

- [ ] With an user which has an age inferior to 18 years old (depending on the country this might change, for example, 14 in Germany), attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be shown a notification.
- [ ] With an user which does not have its age defined, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be prompted for your age (do not fill out the age data please!).


# Kill switch
This cannot be tested using a production build. Instead, checkout the release branch,
change the version code to 377, then:

- [ ] After signing in, the force update dialog is shown
- [ ] After signing up, the force update dialog is shown
- [ ] If already signed in, clear data via settings to force a configuration update;
the force update dialog should be shown
- [ ] Clicking force update closes the current screen and opens the Play Store
- [ ] Soft-Updating will not result in the dialog to show again.
A soft-update does not wipe the app data so make sure you don't uninstall
the blacklisted build first, or the test will be invalid.


# Dev features
- [ ] Login with a non `cloud_people` user and verify the dev drawer is not there.
