# Ads
No proxy is required. You can get ads by signing in with one of [these users](https://github.com/soundcloud/SoundCloud-RAC/wiki/Ads-%26-Promoted-Debugging-and-QA). Search for tracks named "Monetizable" or play one of the playlists of [scandroidad1](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/scandroidad1)
- [ ] Ad is shown before monetizable track
- [ ] Leave behind is shown after ad
- [ ] Ad without leave behind is shown before monetizable track
- [ ] Interstitial is shown
- [ ] Promoted content is shown in stream


# Tracking
- [ ] Ad event tracking to EventLogger & Promoted
- [ ] UI event tracking to Localytics (check requests to https://analytics.localytics.com)
- [ ] Playback session event tracking to EventLogger (check requests to http://eventgateway.soundcloud.com)
- [ ] Playback start sends play count increment to public API (seeking doesn't) - (POST request to /tracks/<track_urn>/plays)
- [ ] Comscore tracking (check request to http://b.scorecardresearch.com)
- [ ] Adjust tracking (check request to https://app.adjust.io:443)
- [ ] Changing users will change the user ID we send with Analytics requests (e.g. look for "customer_id" in localytics and "user" query parameter on event logger audio requests)


# Age Gating
There are already integration tests for it (see ageGating). All you have to do is to check if the proper notification appears.
More info about the current config: https://github.com/soundcloud/public-api-strangler/blob/master/src/main/resources/user-follow-restrictions.json
NOTE: You can use the test user 'underage' (pw: underage) to perform these tests
- [ ] With an user which has an age inferior to 18 years old, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be shown a notification.
- [ ] With an user which does not have its age defined, attempt to follow the [annoymouse](http://sonar.soundcloud.com/users/annoymouse?query=32326572) user. You should not be able to follow the user and will be prompted for your age
